# www.equaljusticestudios.com is a sample of a WordPress site that I worked on.  I inherited a mostly completed site and with my assistance as well as the producer's direction, redid the fonts; redid some of the layout - moved blocks around; added a newsletter page; added some videos, video links and youtube thumbnails; made pictures click downloadable. Wrote a marquee not used. Created a Youtube account and uploaded videos for linking and public access. The site uses Themeisle's Neve theme, Otter and WPForms.  Themeisle themes are built with the new WordPress block editor.
